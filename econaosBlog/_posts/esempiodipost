An open research lifecycle involves sharing of each step of the process, including not only scientific papers but also data (raw and processed), metadata, methods, software. In this way, the process of building on top of the original scientific idea is eased and it profits from a solid and peer reviewd chain of knowledge that leads to new and improved scientific results.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
